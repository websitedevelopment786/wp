Integrating **WebAuthn** into your PHP website enhances security by enabling passwordless authentication, effectively binding user accounts to specific devices. While achieving absolute reliability in enforcing "one user per one machine" is challenging, implementing WebAuthn with best practices can significantly improve security. Below is a comprehensive guide to setting up WebAuthn for your PHP site:

---

## 1. **Prerequisites**

Before integrating WebAuthn, ensure your environment meets the following requirements:

- **PHP Version:** PHP 8.1 or higher is recommended for optimal compatibility with WebAuthn libraries.

- **Browser Support:** Ensure your application runs on a domain with an SSL/TLS certificate, as WebAuthn requires secure contexts.

- **Hardware Requirements:** For enhanced security, especially on Windows, ensure that devices have a Trusted Platform Module (TPM) chip enabled in the BIOS.

---

## 2. **Install the WebAuthn Library**

Use Composer to install a WebAuthn library. For this guide, we'll use the `web-auth/webauthn-lib` package, which provides comprehensive support for WebAuthn in PHP applications.

```bash
composer require web-auth/webauthn-lib
```

---

## 3. **Set Up Database Tables**

Create a database table to store WebAuthn credentials. This table will hold information such as credential IDs, public keys, and associated user details.

```sql
CREATE TABLE webauthn_credentials (
    id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
    user_handle VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    credential_id VARBINARY(255) NOT NULL,
    public_key TEXT NOT NULL,
    counter INT NOT NULL,
    UNIQUE KEY unique_credential (credential_id)
);
```

---

## 4. **Implement Registration and Authentication Endpoints**

Develop endpoints to handle the registration and authentication processes:

### a. **Registration Endpoint**

This endpoint initiates the registration process by generating a challenge and storing the user's WebAuthn credential upon successful registration.

```php
<?php
require 'vendor/autoload.php';

use WebAuthn\WebAuthn;
use WebAuthn\PublicKeyCredentialUserEntity;
use WebAuthn\PublicKeyCredentialRpEntity;
use WebAuthn\AuthenticatorSelectionCriteria;
use WebAuthn\AttestationConveyancePreference;
use WebAuthn\PublicKeyCredentialParameters;
use WebAuthn\COSEAlgorithmIdentifier;

// Initialize WebAuthn
$rpEntity = new PublicKeyCredentialRpEntity('YourApp', 'yourapp.com');
$userEntity = new PublicKeyCredentialUserEntity('user123', 'User Name', 'user@example.com');
$webAuthn = new WebAuthn($rpEntity, 'yourapp.com');

// Generate registration options
$options = $webAuthn->getRegistrationOptions($userEntity, new AuthenticatorSelectionCriteria(), AttestationConveyancePreference::NONE);

// Send options to the client (e.g., as JSON)
echo json_encode($options);

// On the client side, use the WebAuthn API to create a credential
// After creation, send the response back to the server for verification

// Server-side verification and storing the credential
$authData = $_POST['authData']; // Received from client
$clientDataJSON = $_POST['clientDataJSON']; // Received from client

$credential = $webAuthn->processRegistrationResponse($authData, $clientDataJSON);

// Store $credential in your database
?>
```

### b. **Authentication Endpoint**

This endpoint verifies the user's authentication response using the stored public key and authenticates the user upon successful verification.

```php
<?php
require 'vendor/autoload.php';

use WebAuthn\WebAuthn;
use WebAuthn\PublicKeyCredentialRequestOptions;
use WebAuthn\AuthenticatorAssertionResponse;

// Initialize WebAuthn
$rpId = 'yourapp.com';
$webAuthn = new WebAuthn(null, $rpId);

// Retrieve stored credentials from your database
$storedCredential = getStoredCredentialForUser('user123'); // Implement this function

// Generate authentication options
$options = $webAuthn->getAuthenticationOptions([$storedCredential]);

// Send options to the client (e.g., as JSON)
echo json_encode($options);

// On the client side, use the WebAuthn API to get an assertion
// After obtaining the assertion, send the response back to the server for verification

// Server-side verification
$authData = $_POST['authData']; // Received from client
$clientDataJSON = $_POST['clientDataJSON']; // Received from client
$signature = $_POST['signature']; // Received from client

$assertionResponse = new AuthenticatorAssertionResponse($authData, $clientDataJSON, $signature);
$isValid = $webAuthn->processAuthenticationResponse($assertionResponse, [$storedCredential]);

if ($isValid) {
    // Authentication successful
    echo 'Authentication successful';
} else {
    // Authentication failed
    echo 'Authentication failed';
}
?>
```

## 5. **Enhance Security Measures**

To strengthen the security of your WebAuthn implementation:

- **Limit Credential Registration:** Configure your application to allow only one credential per user, preventing users from registering multiple devices without authorization.

- **Enforce Platform Authenticators:** Restrict the use of external security keys, allowing only platform authenticators (e.g., biometrics, device PINs) to bind credentials to specific devices.

- **Use Attestation Statements:** Utilize attestation to verify the authenticity of the authenticator device during registration, ensuring that credentials are stored on trusted devices.

- **Secure Communication:** Ensure that all communications between the client and server are conducted over HTTPS to prevent interception of sensitive data.

---

## 6. **Test and Deploy**

Before deploying your WebAuthn implementation:

- **Conduct Thorough Testing:** Test the registration and authentication processes across various devices and browsers to ensure compatibility and reliability.

- **Monitor and Update:** Regularly monitor authentication logs for suspicious activities and update your WebAuthn library to incorporate security patches and improvements.

---

**Note:** While WebAuthn significantly enhances security, achieving absolute reliability in enforcing "one user per one machine" is inherently challenging due to factors like OS reinstallation or device changes. However, combining WebAuthn with additional security measures can substantially reduce the risk of unauthorized access.
